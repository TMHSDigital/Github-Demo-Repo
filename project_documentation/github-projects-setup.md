Set up your board with the following columns:

1. **Backlog**
   - Issues waiting to be prioritized
   - Not planned for current development cycle

2. **To Do**
   - Prioritized issues that are ready for development
   - All requirements and acceptance criteria are clear

3. **In Progress**
   - Issues actively being worked on
   - Assigned to a team member
   - Has a branch created

4. **In Review**
   - Pull request created
   - Waiting for code review
   - May need changes based on feedback

5. **Testing**
   - Code has been reviewed and approved
   - Ready for QA testing or verification

6. **Done**
   - Feature is complete
   - Merged to main branch
   - Deployed to production (if applicable)

## Automation Settings

Configure these automated workflows:

1. **Newly added items â†’ Backlog**
   - When an issue is created, add to Backlog

2. **In Progress based on status**
   - When a pull request references an issue, move to In Progress

3. **In Review based on status**
   - When a pull request is ready for review, move to In Review

4. **Done based on status**
   - When a pull request is merged, move to Done
   - When an issue is closed, move to Done

## Labels for Categorization

Create the following labels to categorize work:

- `bug`: Something isn't working
- `enhancement`: New feature or request
- `documentation`: Improvements to documentation
- `frontend`: Related to UI components
- `backend`: Related to API or server code
- `security`: Security-related issues
- `api`: API-specific changes
- `ui`: User interface changes
- `test`: Testing-related tasks
- `ci-cd`: CI/CD pipeline changes
- `high-priority`: Needs immediate attention
- `good-first-issue`: Good for newcomers

## Using the Project Board

1. **Creating Issues**
   - Create detailed issues with clear requirements
   - Add appropriate labels
   - Assign to a team member if known

2. **Working on Issues**
   - Move issue to "In Progress" when work begins
   - Create a branch from the issue
   - Reference the issue in PR description with "Fixes #123"

3. **Tracking Progress**
   - Use the board for daily standups
   - Filter by assignee to see individual workloads
   - Track overall project progress

4. **Project Review**
   - Review the board weekly
   - Reprioritize backlog items
   - Close completed milestones
