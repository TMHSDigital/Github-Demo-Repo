## Issue Title: Add User Profile Page

**Labels:** enhancement, frontend, ui
**Assignee:** @frontend-developer
**Milestone:** UI Improvements

## Description

We need to add a user profile page to the UI that will display detailed user information and allow users to edit their profile.

### User Story

As a logged-in user, I want to view and edit my profile information so that I can keep my details up to date.

### Requirements

- Create a new route `/profile` in the UI
- Display current user information:
  - Username
  - Email
  - Role
  - Account creation date
  - Last login date
- Allow editing of:
  - Email
  - Display name
  - Password (with confirmation)
- Add profile picture upload functionality
- Include form validation for all editable fields

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Profile page is accessible from the main navigation
- [ ] All user information is displayed correctly
- [ ] Form validation prevents invalid inputs
- [ ] Changes are saved to the database via API
- [ ] Password change requires current password verification
- [ ] Profile picture can be uploaded and displayed
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile devices

### Technical Notes

- Use the existing API endpoint `/api/user/:id` for fetching user data
- Create a new API endpoint `/api/user/:id/update` for updating user information
- Create a separate endpoint for password changes
- Use secure file upload for profile pictures with size and type restrictions
