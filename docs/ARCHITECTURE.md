# Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the GitHub Demo Repository, explaining how different components interact and the design decisions behind the implementation.

## System Components

```

├── src/               # Core source code
│   └── api/           # REST API implementation

```

## Core Components

### API Layer (`/src/api`)

The API layer is built with Node.js and Express, providing RESTful endpoints for client applications. Key design principles:

- Modular routing with Express Router
- Middleware-based authentication
- Environment-based configuration
- Structured error handling

### UI Components (`/examples/ui`)

The UI dashboard demonstrates:

- React component architecture
- Data visualization with Chart.js
- Responsive design patterns
- API integration techniques

## Infrastructure

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our GitHub Actions workflows demonstrate:

1. Automated testing on pull requests
2. Dependency scanning and updates
3. Deployment to staging and production environments
4. Code quality checks

### Security Measures

- Branch protection rules prevent direct pushes to main
- Dependabot scans for vulnerable dependencies
- Secrets management via GitHub Secrets

## Design Decisions

This repository follows these architectural principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Code is organized by responsibility
2. **Modularity**: Each feature is self-contained
3. **Documentation as Code**: Documentation lives with the code
4. **Automation First**: Manual processes are automated where possible
